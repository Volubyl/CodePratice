# Code Practice

Code Practice is a small repository containing my personal algorithmic practice. Those exercices are based on multiple sources such as HackerRank, CodeWars or the magnificent book `Grokking Algorithms` (by Aditya Y. Bhargava, published by Manning).

In the repo you can find my implementation of [Breadth First](business/grokkingAlgorithms/breadthfirst.js) or [Jikstra](business/grokkingAlgorithms/jikstra.js).

## Disclaimer

The algorithms implementation contained in this repository are NOT production ready. Those are mainly a "first implementation attempt" and were written for learning purpose only. They could be optimised for sure.

Please do not use them "as-is".
